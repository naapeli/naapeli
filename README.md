## About Me

I'm a Finnish mathematics student at Aalto University, expecting to complete my bachelor's degree in December 2024. My minor is in data science, with a strong emphasis on machine learning and artificial intelligence. I’m a result-driven and passionate learner, proficient in data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, primarily using Python.

I have developed strong leadership skills through military training at the Reserve Officer School and my experience as a basketball referee. These roles sharpened my ability to make quick, confident decisions, resolve conflicts, and maintain control in high-pressure environments. I thrive in fast-paced settings and am continuously focused on personal growth, self-improvement and learning.

## Ongoing Projects
1. [DLL](https://github.com/naapeli/deep-learning-library) is a deep learning library inspired by TensorFlow. This is my largest project to date, featuring thousands of lines of code. It encompasses a wide range of deep learning and machine learning methods, and includes numerous examples and tests to demonstrate their usage.

## Upcoming Projects
1. [CalcLite](https://github.com/naapeli/CalcLite) is a programming language designed for mathematical calculations. This project is currently on hold while I work on DLL, a deep learning library. Once DLL is finished, I will return to CalcLite.

## Finished Projects
1. [JavaScript chess engine](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Javascript%20projects/Chess%20engine) was my attempt to challenge a highly skilled friend at chess. Recognizing my limitations in chess skills, I aimed to leverage my coding knowledge to create an engine capable of evaluating many more positions than a human could. Despite the challenges, I gained invaluable experience and learned a lot during this project.

2. [Guitar string simulation](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Python%20projects/Guitar%20string%20simulation) is a project where I applied the wave equation to simulate the vibrations of a guitar string. Using this model, I recreated Passenger's Let Her Go as a demonstration of how Python can be used to generate music.

3. [3D path visualisation tool](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Python%20projects/3D%20path-finding%20visualisation) is a tool to compare different path finding algorithms in a 3 dimensional grid.

4. [Flappy bird AI](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Python%20projects/flappy%20bird%20machine%20learning) is a project where I used [NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) to train neural networks to play flappy bird.

5. [Buffon's needle tool](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Python%20projects/Buffon's%20needle%20problem) is a visualisation tool to approximate the value of π.
