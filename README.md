## About Me

I'm a 22-year-old Finnish mathematics student at Aalto University, expecting to complete my bachelor's degree in December 2024. My minor is in data science, with a strong emphasis on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Iâ€™m a result-driven and passionate learner, proficient in data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, primarily using Python.

I have leadership experience gained from military training at the Reserve Officer School and basketball refereeing, which has honed my ability to make quick decisions, de-escalate conflicts, and maintain authority in high-pressure situations. I thrive in fast-paced environments and am committed to growth and self-improvement in all areas of life.

## Ongoing projects
[DLL](https://github.com/naapeli/deep-learning-library) is a deep learning library inspired by TensorFlow. This is my largest project to date, featuring thousands of lines of code. It encompasses a wide range of deep learning and machine learning methods, and includes numerous examples and tests to demonstrate their usage.

## Upcoming projects
[CalcLite](https://github.com/naapeli/CalcLite) is a programming language designed for mathematical calculations. This project is currently on hold while I work on DLL, a deep learning library. Once DLL is finished, I will return to CalcLite.

## Finished projects
[JavaScript chess engine](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Javascript%20projects/Chess%20engine) was my attempt to challenge a highly skilled friend at chess. Recognizing my limitations in chess skills, I aimed to leverage my coding knowledge to create an engine capable of evaluating many more positions than a human could. Despite the challenges, I gained invaluable experience and learned a lot during this project.
