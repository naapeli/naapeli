## About Me

I'm a Finnish mathematics student at Aalto University, expecting to complete my bachelor's degree in December 2024. My minor is in data science, with a strong emphasis on machine learning and artificial intelligence. I’m a result-driven and passionate learner, proficient in data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, primarily using Python.

I have developed strong leadership skills through military training at the Reserve Officer School and my experience as a basketball referee. These roles sharpened my ability to make quick, confident decisions, resolve conflicts, and maintain control in high-pressure environments. I thrive in fast-paced settings and am continuously focused on personal growth, self-improvement and learning.

## Sustainable Finance in the Quantum Era Hackathon
I am part of the winning team at the Ultrahack hackathon in 2024. In about 36 hours, we were able to make an entire business plan and execute most of the technology behind the concept. Our solution was a portfolio optimization and pprediction platform intended to be embedded into a stock broker's website. We implemented two optimization algorithms with both classical and quantum methods. In addition, we implemented a geometric brownian motion based prediction tool using the monte carlo method, as well as, incorporated impact data from [The Upright Project](https://www.uprightproject.com/). The project and the pitch slides can be found below:

## Featured Projects
1. [DLL](https://github.com/naapeli/deep-learning-library) is a deep learning library inspired by TensorFlow. This is my largest project to date, featuring thousands of lines of code. It encompasses a wide range of deep learning and machine learning methods, and includes numerous examples and tests to demonstrate their usage.

## Upcoming Projects
1. [CalcLite](https://github.com/naapeli/CalcLite) is a programming language designed for mathematical calculations. This project is currently on hold while I work on DLL, a deep learning library. Once DLL is finished, I will return to CalcLite.
2. A Python ray tracing software

## Other Projects
1. [JavaScript chess engine](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Javascript%20projects/Chess%20engine) was my attempt to challenge a highly skilled friend at chess. Recognizing my limitations in chess skills, I aimed to leverage my coding knowledge to create an engine capable of evaluating many more positions than a human could. Despite the challenges, I gained invaluable experience and learned a lot during this project.

2. [Guitar string simulation](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Python%20projects/Guitar%20string%20simulation) is a project where I applied the wave equation to simulate the vibrations of a guitar string. Using this model, I recreated Passenger's Let Her Go as a demonstration of how Python can be used to generate music.

3. [3D path visualisation tool](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Python%20projects/3D%20path-finding%20visualisation) is a tool to compare different path finding algorithms in a 3 dimensional grid.

4. [Flappy bird AI](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Python%20projects/flappy%20bird%20machine%20learning) is a project where I used [NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) to train neural networks to play flappy bird.

5. [Buffon's needle tool](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Python%20projects/Buffon's%20needle%20problem) is a visualisation tool to approximate the value of π.
